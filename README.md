# YarnHandler
A home project of mine, originally for my sister.
The program handles yarncolors of DMC and Anchor standards.
You can add or remove colors to the ones you have, search the ones you have (including cross-reference between the different standards) and if some colors exists, (optionally) the closest ones will be dislayed.

Enjoy
